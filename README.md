# My personal journey 
After using Cryptocurrencies since 2017, I decided to give a step forward (i know, a bit late) and actually learn about the ecosystem that is built around blockchain and how it solves real problems.

I'm mostly interested in the DAOs since I think they are going to be the future of how organizations are managed and I want to be part of it.

This repo is just to write interesting stuff I read related with this journey, and as I said before, most of it will be about Ethereum, Solidity, DAOs, etc..

Thank you for reading :)
